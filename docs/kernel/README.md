# Kernel changes: what we touch, whose code it is, what is new

The counterpart of [`../device_tree/README.md`](../device_tree/README.md) for the
C code. Almost nothing here is a new driver: every file is somebody else's work
with a Fairphone 3 shaped hole filled in. This page says, per file, **where it
came from and from whom**, **what we added and what that was derived from**, and
**what genuinely did not exist before**.

Measured on `integration/7.1.3` against its base `v7.1.3-r0`. Everything in the
"what we add" column was developed with the assistance of
[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code); how that is recorded in the
commits, and where the result may and may not go, is in the
[top-level README](../../README.md#ai-assisted-development).

## The files

Eleven files, 3168 insertions — audio, camera and charger. The `sensor` and
`debug` categories are not in this table: the SMGR/QRTR sensor stack and the
watchdog change are written up in
[`../sensors/README.md`](../sensors/README.md#provenance), where the measurements
that produced them are.

| file | Δ lines | whose code it is |

| `Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/supply/qcom,pmi8998-charger.yaml` | +73 / −1 | the SMB2 charger binding — **Casey Connolly**, added with the driver; extended here for the PMI632 |

`drivers/slimbus/qcom-ngd-ctrl.c` and `drivers/remoteproc/qcom_q6v5_pas.c` used
to be in this list. Both changes were **reverted on 2026-07-29** after
measurement showed they did nothing; see
[the framer pair](#the-qdsp6ss-slimbus-framer-pair--removed) below.

## Provenance

The same three questions the [sensor stack](../sensors/README.md#provenance) is
sorted by: what is carried unchanged, what is somebody else's code that we
extended, and what did not exist before.

### Imported unchanged

**`drivers/media/i2c/imx363.c`** arrived as somebody else's file and was then
modified here, so it is an import first and an extension second — the same shape
as the sensor stack, which carries Yassine Oudjana's SMGR series. This was
**recorded wrongly on this page until 2026-07-30**, where it said the driver was
"entirely ours in substance"; see [Camera](#camera-imx363c). Since 2026-07-30 the
branch says so too: the import is [its own
commit](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/cda174905a83) authored by Joel
Selvaraj, and our change sits on top of it.

Every other file above is an in-place change to code that was already in the
base.

### Imported and extended here

| component | file | whose code | what we added |
|---|---|---|---|
| WCD9335 codec | `wcd9335.c` | Srinivas Kandagatla, [`20aedafdf492`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/20aedafdf4926e7a957f8b302a18c8fb75c7e332) | init fix, TX front-end hold release, DT-driven mic bias and DMIC rate, the move onto the shared MBHC, capture gains |
| MBHC jack detection | `wcd-mbhc-v2.c`, `wcd9335.c` | the kernel's own shared MBHC, whose `WCD_DETECTION_LEGACY` enum and `mbhc_detection_logic` field were already there with no second user | the **legacy comparator backend** behind a `wcd_mbhc_fn` table, and the wcd9335 side of it: the register field map, the codec callbacks, the button-threshold conversion and the interrupt mapping. A private implementation revived from Kandagatla's **[2018 MBHC series](https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1809.3/03254.html), which never merged**, came first and was deleted — see [`audio/bringup/jack/`](../audio/bringup/jack/) |
| msm8916 machine driver | `apq8016_sbc.c` | Kandagatla, [`bdb052e81f62`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/bdb052e81f6236b4febb50ed74f79f770fa82cc5) | a SLIMbus backend, following how the existing WCD9335 machine drivers wire the codec |
| Q6 Voice DAI | `q6voice-dai.c` | Gerhold / Knecht / Pflüger — **not upstream**, carried by [msm8953-mainline](https://github.com/msm8953-mainline/linux/blob/v7.1.3-r0/sound/soc/qcom/qdsp6/q6voice-dai.c) | the VoiceMMode1 / CS-Voice mixer routes to `SLIMBUS_0_RX/TX`, including the mixer → port output edge |
| Q6 AFE | `q6afe.c` | Kandagatla, [`7fa2d70f9766`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7fa2d70f976657111a5ea4f3d16a738ddaa10c4f) | `ADSP_EALREADY` on `AFE_PORT_CMD_DEVICE_START` treated as success |
| SMB2 charger | `qcom_smbx.c` | Casey Connolly, [`5ec53bcc7fce`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/5ec53bcc7fce6801977a0c125fb726d7b0e9102c) | the SMB5 variant abstraction, PMI632 support, `POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_TEMP` |
| PMIC ADC5 | `qcom-spmi-adc5.c` | Siddartha Mohanadoss, [`e13d757279bb`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e13d757279bb2c2fa32e5b578dd1cbcac4d51e21) | the `BAT_THERM` channel table entry — the scaling curve it points at was already there |
| IMX363 sensor | `imx363.c` | **Joel Selvaraj**, [`5130bc702ea2`](https://gitlab.com/sdm670-mainline/linux/-/commit/5130bc702ea2efc53f6b652b4282067ee9ae7fd2) on `sdm670-mainline/linux` (merge request !3), reverse-engineered there; structured in turn on an **Intel** IMX3xx driver whose copyright line stays | +68 / −21: MCLK before reset, a 200 ms boot delay, an I²C warm-up in `power_on()`, `vdig` at 1.175 V. **The register tables came with the import** |

### New here

Written for this port; author Lajosházi, László Gergely with Claude.

| component | where | state |
|---|---|---|
| FP3 WCD9335 sound card + DMIC widgets | `apq8016_sbc.c` | working |
| IMX363 **power sequence and I²C bring-up** (not the register tables) | `imx363.c` | sensor probes; streaming blocked on the CAMSS side |
| Battery temperature | `qcom_smbx.c`, `qcom-spmi-adc5.c`, `pmi632.dtsi` | see [Battery temperature](#battery-temperature) |
| IMX363 **device-tree binding** | `sony,imx363.yaml` | written 2026-07-31, modelled on `sony,imx258.yaml` but deliberately looser on `data-lanes` and stricter on the supplies — see [`../TODO.md`](../TODO.md#open-before-anything-is-submitted) item 1 |

### Fixes to pre-existing kernel code

| file | fix |
|---|---|
| `wcd9335.c` | `wcd9335_codec_enable_adc()` takes the TX front-end hold and mainline never releases it, so the decimator returns exact zero. Nobody had noticed because nobody had captured audio on this codec in mainline |
| `wcd9335.c` | the `DEC0..DEC8` capture gain registers exist and mirror the RX ones exactly; the driver simply never exposed them, so capture level could not be set at all |
| `q6afe.c` | `ADSP_EALREADY` became `-EINVAL`, which is unrecoverable in practice — nothing on the AP side can reset the ADSP's port state. Not FP3-specific: any two front ends sharing one backend hit it |
| `qcom-spmi-adc5.c` | `ADC5_BAT_THERM_100K_PU` was missing from the channel table, so a device tree referencing the battery thermistor was rejected at probe |

### Values taken from the vendor

Read out of Fairphone's published kernel source release. Its **device trees are
checked in here**, under
[`../device_tree/downstream/fairphone/3.A.0136/`](../device_tree/downstream/fairphone/3.A.0136/),
so those links stay valid whatever happens upstream. The **driver sources are
not** — for those the links point at
[UBports' publication of the same tree](https://gitlab.com/ubports/porting/community-ports/android10/fairphone/android_kernel_fairphone_sdm632),
which is the same 4.9 kernel with the Halium patches on top.

| what | source |
|---|---|
| mic-bias voltage, DMIC clock rate | downstream [`msm8953-audio.dtsi`](../device_tree/downstream/fairphone/3.A.0136/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8953-audio.dtsi) |
| the codec init sequence the fix was found against | downstream [`techpack/audio/asoc/codecs/wcd9335.c`](https://gitlab.com/ubports/porting/community-ports/android10/fairphone/android_kernel_fairphone_sdm632/-/blob/halium-10.0/techpack/audio/asoc/codecs/wcd9335.c) |
| SMB5 register offsets, current step, charge-status bit positions | downstream [`qpnp-smb2.c`](https://gitlab.com/ubports/porting/community-ports/android10/fairphone/android_kernel_fairphone_sdm632/-/blob/halium-10.0/drivers/power/supply/qcom/qpnp-smb2.c) / [`qpnp-smb5.c`](https://gitlab.com/ubports/porting/community-ports/android10/fairphone/android_kernel_fairphone_sdm632/-/blob/halium-10.0/drivers/power/supply/qcom/qpnp-smb5.c), [`smb5-reg.h`](https://gitlab.com/ubports/porting/community-ports/android10/fairphone/android_kernel_fairphone_sdm632/-/blob/halium-10.0/drivers/power/supply/qcom/smb5-reg.h) |
| PMI632 interrupt numbers and ADC channel assignment | downstream [`pmi632.dtsi`](../device_tree/downstream/fairphone/3.A.0136/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/pmi632.dtsi) |
| `BAT_THERM` channel number, 100k pull-up, ratiometric calibration | downstream [`pmi632.dtsi`](../device_tree/downstream/fairphone/3.A.0136/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/pmi632.dtsi), `chan@4a` |
| the OCV curve behind `capacity`, and the cell parameters beside it | downstream [`qg-batterydata-Fuji-3000mah-Jan22th2019-pmi632.dtsi`](../device_tree/downstream/fairphone/3.A.0136/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/qg-batterydata-Fuji-3000mah-Jan22th2019-pmi632.dtsi) — **Fuji**, the pack this phone measures as fitted, not the Kayo this row used to name |

## Audio: the WCD9335 codec

Six commits on `sound/soc/codecs/wcd9335.c`. Kandagatla's driver supports the
codec on MSM8996 boards; the FP3 is the first MSM8953 user, and capture never
worked on any of them.

| commit | what it does | where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| [`b3a83765fa54`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/b3a83765fa54) | fix codec init: select the efuse sense state before enabling sensing, set `MCLK_CFG` bit 2 | **new** — found by comparing against the downstream Qualcomm sequence |
| [`ad3bfc32011b`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/ad3bfc32011b) | release the TX front-end hold after the ADC is up | **new** — `wcd9335_codec_enable_adc()` takes the hold and mainline never releases it, so the decimator returns exact zero. Nobody had noticed because nobody had captured audio on this codec in mainline |
| [`cb8efad0cd2a`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/cb8efad0cd2a) | take mic-bias voltage and DMIC clock rate from the DT | the property names follow the existing WCD9335 binding; the FP3's values come from Fairphone's downstream `msm8953-audio.dtsi` |
| [`b486048d9442`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/b486048d9442) | map the two headphone OCP fault interrupts | **new here** — trivial, but the shared MBHC requires both, and the mainline driver never mapped them |
| [`e665515a2de6`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/e665515a2de6) | move the codec onto the shared MBHC | **reused from the tree** — this replaced a private implementation revived from Kandagatla's [2018 MBHC series](https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1809.3/03254.html). The register field table, the callbacks and the button-threshold conversion are FP3 work; the state machine is the kernel's |
| [`741df01d2966`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/741df01d2966) | expose the `DEC0..DEC8` capture gains | **new** — the registers exist and mirror the RX ones exactly; the driver simply never exposed them, so capture level could not be set at all |

Two more commits in this series are on `sound/soc/codecs/wcd-mbhc-v2.c` rather
than on the codec: [`d02280cd75dc`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/d02280cd75dc)
adds the legacy comparator backend behind a `wcd_mbhc_fn` table, and
[`67485baf1cf0`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/67485baf1cf0) stops the
shared code enabling an interrupt it cannot balance.

☠️ A hash quoted on this page stops being the branch tip's version of that change
the moment the branch is rebuilt — the cherry-pick onto `integration`, and the
next rebase, both give it a new one. The links keep working because the old tip
was tagged under `archive/*` before the rewrite, which is the whole reason that
convention exists; they may nonetheless point at an *archived twin* of the commit
rather than the one on the branch today. Resolve by subject, not by hash.

## Audio: the machine driver

[`35f5d0f76e5d`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/35f5d0f76e5d) on `sound/soc/qcom/apq8016_sbc.c` adds a SLIMbus backend, the FP3
WCD9335 card definition and the digital-microphone DAPM widgets. The SLIMbus
backend follows how the existing WCD9335 machine drivers wire the codec; the card
itself is FP3-specific and **new**.

## Audio: the Q6 DSP side

* [`34f6f8bf16a6`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/34f6f8bf16a6) — `q6voice-dai.c`: wire the VoiceMMode1 / CS-Voice mixers to
  `SLIMBUS_0_RX/TX`, including the mixer → port output route. It goes on top of a
  driver that is itself not upstream (Gerhold / Knecht / Pflüger, above). Without
  it a call could only use the MI2S speaker path.

  ☠️ **It is not new, and this page called it new until 2026-07-30.** The same
  routing already existed, line for line — the SLIMbus voice mixers, the
  `SLIMBUS_0_TX` capture entries and the `"SLIMBUS_0_RX" <- "SLIMBUS_0_RX Voice
  Mixer"` output edge whose absence we recorded as our own discovery — in
  **Joel Selvaraj's** *"q6voice-dai: implement all slimbus tx and rx"*
  (`5a63debde2db`, 2022-10-02), carried on `sdm670-mainline/linux` branch
  `rdacayan/for-sdm845/q6voice-series`. His version is a superset: SLIMBUS_0
  through SLIMBUS_6, where ours does SLIMBUS_0 only. The two differ in that scope
  and in one ASoC rename (`snd_soc_dapm_kcontrol_dapm` →
  `_to_dapm`) — nothing else. Archived as
  [`vendor/q6voice-sdm670`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/tree/vendor/q6voice-sdm670).

  The lesson is not about credit — nobody's work was published as ours, the
  commit was written before the prior art was found. It is that **the same search
  that found the camera's origin would have found this one**, and it was never
  run for `voice`. Where a subsystem is out-of-tree, look for who else carries it
  *before* writing the patch, not after.
* [`867e40aa8ebd`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/867e40aa8ebd) + [`6f5f64855a18`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/6f5f64855a18) — `q6afe.c`: treat `ADSP_EALREADY` on
  `AFE_PORT_CMD_DEVICE_START` as success. **New**, and not FP3-specific: any two
  front ends sharing one backend hit it. Here a call and a media stream both use
  `SLIMBUS_0_RX`, the ADSP answers `ADSP_EALREADY`, and the driver turned that
  into `-EINVAL` — unrecoverable in practice, because nothing on the AP side can
  reset the ADSP's port state.

## The QDSP6SS SLIMbus framer pair — removed

Two commits used to clear QDSP6SS `0x0c20002c` bit 3, one in `qcom_q6v5_pas.c`
after `AUTH_AND_RESET` and one in `qcom-ngd-ctrl.c` before the capability
exchange, plus the `qcom,slim-framer-quirk-reg` device tree property that armed
the second. **All three are gone since 2026-07-29**, reverted after measurement
showed the codec comes up, and sound crosses SLIMbus in both directions,
without them — and that the PAS one never wrote anything in the first place
(`0x101->0x101`).

The whole story, including the log lines that read like faults and are not, is
in [`../audio/bringup/qdsp6ss-framer-poke.md`](../audio/bringup/qdsp6ss-framer-poke.md).

## Camera: `imx363.c`

**This section stated the opposite of the truth until 2026-07-30.** It used to
say the driver was "the only file here that is entirely ours in substance" and
that "the register programming was reverse-engineered from the sensor as wired on
the FP3". Neither is true. The driver is somebody else's work with a Fairphone 3
power sequence bolted on, and the series is now shaped that way.

### Where it actually comes from

Retrieved on 2026-07-30, after the earlier searches failed — `panpanpanpan/linux`
does not exist on GitHub, which is why the "GitHub fetch of that path returns
nothing" note used to stand in for an answer. The repository is on **GitLab**:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| repository | <https://gitlab.com/sdm670-mainline/linux> |
| commit | `5130bc702ea2efc53f6b652b4282067ee9ae7fd2` |
| subject | *media: i2c: Add imx363 image sensor driver* |
| **author** | **Joel Selvaraj `<foss@joelselvaraj.com>`, 2024-08-15** |
| committer | Richard Acayan, 2024-08-21 |
| merged via | [merge request !3](https://gitlab.com/sdm670-mainline/linux/-/merge_requests/3), branch `imx363wip`, author Pan Ortiz, merged 2024-08-22 as `beca831729fd` |
| in turn | a cherry-pick of `d38f36430bd6` |

So even the attribution this page carried for one day — "taken from
`panpanpanpan`" — named the wrong person: Pan Ortiz opened the merge request and
wrote its device tree; **the driver is Joel Selvaraj's**. The `imx363wip` branch
has since been deleted, and the commit had to be fetched by SHA.

The file is structured on the in-tree Intel IMX3xx drivers and keeps
`Copyright (C) 2018 Intel Corporation` plus the three Intel `MODULE_AUTHOR`
lines. The register values are not measurements, and the source says so itself in
95 `//` comments, among them:

```c
//Magical IMX363 Regs & Values - Found in downstream.
// basically frame length lines? from downstream
// present in imx258. not present in android downstream logs.
636000000ULL, // NOT SURE HOW TO FIND THIS VALUE
```

The last is a link frequency the author could not account for. Related and still
open: the driver's two modes carry link frequencies that **disagree with the DT's
`link-frequencies`**, which is the deepest known problem in the camera bring-up.

### The delta, measured

The claim used to be that the size of our change was unknowable without the
original file. With the original file in hand it is a two-command answer, and
[`vendor/imx363-sdm670`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/tree/vendor/imx363-sdm670)
keeps it answerable — an archival snapshot whose tree is byte-identical to the
source commit's, so nothing depends on GitLab still being there.

**1514 lines in, 1568 out: 12 hunks, +68 / −21.** About half of that is comment
typos, whitespace and two tree-wide renames. What is functionally ours is four
things, all in the power path:

* **MCLK before reset.** INCK must be running and stable before XCLR is released;
  the import released reset first and the sensor never booted.
* **A 200 ms boot delay.** The IMX363 only ACKs on I²C ~150 ms after power-up on
  this board's slow GPIO-switched rails, so the import's ~10 ms wait always
  expired.
* **An I²C warm-up loop in `power_on()`.** The first transaction after power-up
  times out anyway, and `power_on()` runs on every runtime-PM resume, not only at
  probe — so the timeout is absorbed there instead of being handed to the caller.
  Without it, streaming register writes time out and CAMSS never receives frames.
* **`vdig` pinned to 1.175 V.** It is a shared PMIC LDO that otherwise sits at its
  0.975 V minimum, below what the digital core needs.

Plus `<asm/unaligned.h>` → `<linux/unaligned.h>`, `MODULE_LICENSE("GPL v2")` →
`"GPL"`, and comment tidying. **The register tables, the mode definitions and the
control ranges are untouched.**

The I²C address `0x1a` — the FP3 straps SLASEL high, confirmed by reading `0x0363`
from register `0x0016` — used to be listed here as a driver change. It is not:
the address appears nowhere in the `.c` file, it is the `reg` property in the
device tree.

### How the series is shaped now

`submit/7.1.3/camera` is three commits, and `wip/7.1.3/camera` is the same three
(there is nothing to distil, so they are literally the same commits):

| commit | author | what |
|---|---|---|
| [`cda174905a83`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/cda174905a83) | **Joel Selvaraj** | the import, verbatim — file, `Kconfig` entry and `Makefile` line byte-identical to the source |
| [`942e4db3f425`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/942e4db3f425) | Lajosházi, László Gergely | the four power-path changes above |
| [`0c7ea33fa5c5`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/0c7ea33fa5c5) | Lajosházi, László Gergely | the device-tree node |

The import commit carries the original `Signed-off-by` chain — Joel Selvaraj,
panpanpanpan, Richard Acayan — with ours added on the end, which is what
forwarding somebody else's patch requires. The DCO chain is therefore **intact**;
the camera was never in the position the sensor series is in, where the imported
base carries no sign-off at all.

Splitting also localises the checkpatch damage, which is worth seeing:

| commit | `checkpatch --strict` |
|---|---|
| import | 4 errors, 17 warnings — all inherited, none introduced here |
| our delta | 0 errors, 1 warning (one over-long `//` comment we touch for a typo) |
| device tree | 0 errors, 2 warnings |

As one commit those numbers were indistinguishable from our own sloppiness. The
17 warnings are the next reviewer's first question and they belong to the
import — which is an argument for cleaning them in a *third* commit rather than
quietly folding the cleanup into the import and destroying the byte-identity that
makes the import checkable.

## Charger: `qcom_smbx.c`

[`24e5c045b8fc`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/24e5c045b8fc) adds SMB5 (PMI632) support to Casey Connolly's SMB2 driver. The
differences are described in the variant structure rather than open-coded: the
status register prefix (MISC `0x600` on SMB2, DCDC `0x100` on SMB5), the current
step (25 mA vs 50 mA), the charge-status bit positions, and the JEITA status
register, which SMB5 moved into `BATTERY_CHARGER_STATUS_7`.

**Where the numbers come from:** Qualcomm's downstream `qpnp-smb2` and
`qpnp-smb5` drivers, published in the Fairphone 3 kernel source release — the
same release checked in under
[`../device_tree/downstream/fairphone/3.A.0136/`](../device_tree/downstream/fairphone/3.A.0136/).
**New** is the variant abstraction and the PMI632 support itself; PMI632 also has
no coulomb-counting fuel gauge in mainline, so capacity comes from the OCV table
in the board's `simple-battery` node.

Six further commits turn the charge current from a constant into something the
board describes, add the two guards that made raising it defensible, and then
put each of those values at the layer that owns it:

| commit | what it adds |
|---|---|
| [`51803fe941cb`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/51803fe941cb825a5fe8d26e3d2a8a7374296758) | the hardware JEITA comparator thresholds and the per-soft-zone charge currents. The block was already *running* on the PMIC's generic defaults; this replaces them with the pack's characterised values, carried as raw ADC codes |
| [`5a736a69f51e`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/5a736a69f51e3a473776cc9c1c5c8f4b51b9a2f5) | the fast-charge current as a `thermal_cooling_device`, so a thermal zone can throttle charging the way it throttles a CPU |
| [`20c8679e024c`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/20c8679e024c384b38f66e9d07a612be9b911883) | `constant-charge-current-max-microamp` actually reaching the hardware |
| [`5c8991aaa5b2`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/5c8991aaa5b23ef39574c05021339274acbedc26) | **the ceiling on it becomes the PMIC's datasheet maximum** rather than a policy number. The previous commit had bounded the device tree with a new per-generation constant — 2 A on the PMI632, which is the rating of one Fairphone's battery, not of the chip — so every other PMI632 board would have been held to it |
| [`60afc91548aa`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/60afc91548aa7edeb7c44ce710fcd966ccf3bc44) | the JEITA description read from the **battery** node instead of the charger's. Which temperatures a cell may be charged at is a property of the cell, and with it on the charger a board could not describe two packs |
| [`bac69263baf0`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/bac69263baf0d24619d8aac20e1e3efe629cb828) | the battery ID verified before any of the battery's limits are applied, so a board that names one pack cannot silently charge the other to it |
| [`c8974511d585`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/c8974511d585fa02a496797ddbb91fc395b0b801) | thermal mitigation clamps to the programmed current instead of refusing to probe above it — otherwise the outcome of the fallback above was a phone with no charger driver |
| [`dd590915e536`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/dd590915e536) | the **binding**: `qcom,pmi632-charger` documented in the existing `qcom,pmi8998-charger.yaml` rather than a second file, together with the three optional io-channels, `qcom,thermal-mitigation`, `#cooling-cells` and `qcom,batt-id-pullup-ohm`. This closed the last `checkpatch` item on the submit series |
| [`76974ab78023`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/76974ab78023) | the cooling-map nodes renamed to `map-charger-*`, because `thermal-zones.yaml` requires `^map[-a-zA-Z0-9]*$` and the original `charger-warm` failed `dtbs_check`. Nothing reads those names at runtime |

Why the result is 2 A and not the pack's rated 2.7 A, what the JEITA
compensation register can and cannot express, and the register-level
before/after are all on the charger page:
[**`../charger/README.md`**](../charger/README.md).

### Battery temperature

The pack thermistor sits on the same PMIC ADC as `VBAT_SNS`, so reporting a
temperature took one more channel — but the channel was unusable: `ADC5_BAT_THERM_100K_PU`
was missing from `qcom-spmi-adc5.c`'s channel table, so any device tree
referencing it was rejected at probe. Three commits: the ADC channel, the
`POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_TEMP` in `qcom_smbx.c` (optional, like `VBAT_SNS` — a board
that does not route the thermistor keeps a battery without a temperature), and
the PMI632 device-tree channel.

**The curve is approximate, and knowingly so.** The driver scales it with the
generic 100k pull-up thermistor table that mainline already uses for the AMUX
and GPIO thermistor channels. Fairphone's downstream kernel carries its *own*
table for this pack — the comment above it says as much: *"Fill the correct NTC
table for 8901 battery"*. Comparing the two, the tables agree exactly at 25 °C
and diverge with distance from it: about 1.5 °C high at 0 °C, 1 °C low at 40 °C,
2.5 °C low at 60 °C. Same 100 kΩ nominal thermistor, slightly different beta.
That is good enough to report a temperature and to notice a hot battery; it is
not good enough to drive a JEITA charging profile, and nothing here does.

**Measured on the phone**, `linux-fp3-7.1.3-r19` (`#20-fp3`). At idle the pack
reads 28.5 °C against a 37 °C PMIC die and 41 °C CPUs — the right order for a
lump of lithium inside a warm phone. That it is a live thermistor and not a
plausible constant was checked by driving all eight cores flat out and then
letting it cool:

| | battery | CPU0 |
|---|---|---|
| idle | 28.6 °C | 41 °C |
| 90 s of load | 30.2 °C | 74 °C |
| 4½ min of load | 34.4 °C | 80 °C |
| 6 min after load stopped | 31.6 °C | 37 °C |

The pack rises and falls monotonically, an order of magnitude more slowly than
the silicon, and lags it in both directions. `POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_TEMP` also gets
the battery a `pmi632-battery` thermal zone from the power supply core, so
userspace sees it the same way it sees `tsens`.

The regression check is [`51-battery-temp`](../../tests/checks/51-battery-temp-test.sh),
kept **separate from `50-charger`** on purpose: that one declares
`Requires: cable` and is skipped whole without one, while the thermistor is read
through the ADC whether anything is charging or not. Folding it in there would
have hidden the property in exactly the runs that do not plug the phone in.

## What the checkers say

Run on 2026-07-30, per submit branch, and re-run for `audio` after that day's
device-tree work. `checkpatch.pl --strict --git` over each
series, and `dtbs_check` with `dtschema` 2026.6 — the latter **as a differential**,
because the base tree fails it 44 times on its own (`opp-avg-kBps`, `qfprom`,
`gcc` power domains, `rpm-proc`). Only the errors this tree *adds* are ours:

| series | checkpatch | what `dtbs_check` blames on us |
|---|---|---|
| `charger` | **clean** (9 patches, 0/0/0) | the `battery` node's four `qcom,*` properties |
| `sensor` | **clean** (1 patch) | — |
| `voice` | **clean** (1 patch) | — |
| `audio` | 3 × `ENOTSUPP`, 2 × `slim217` — **both false**, see below | **none** (was three, all fixed 2026-07-30) |
| `camera` | 4 errors / 17 warnings on the **import** commit, all inherited; **0 / 1** on our delta, 0 / 2 on the device tree | — |
| (`debug`) | not submitted by design | `qcom,start-at-probe` — undocumented on purpose |

The two dismissed audio warnings, checked rather than assumed:

* **`ENOTSUPP`.** `snd_soc_dai_set_channel_map()` and `get_channel_map()` return
  exactly that (`sound/soc/soc-dai.c`), the base `apq8016_sbc.c` already compares
  against it twice, and six other qcom machine drivers do the same. Taking
  checkpatch's advice and switching to `EOPNOTSUPP` would break the comparison.
* **`slim217`.** Genuinely absent from `vendor-prefixes.yaml`, but four device
  trees already in Linus' tree use it (db820c, OnePlus 3/3T, Xiaomi, sdm845).
  A tree-wide gap, not something this port introduced.

The audio row was also **understated** until it was re-measured: alongside the
two dismissed warnings the series carried **five** `CHECK: Alignment should
match open parenthesis`, in MBHC call sites that an earlier alignment pass had
missed. They are fixed, so the row above is now the whole story for that series.

What each of the remaining errors needs is listed in
[`../TODO.md`](../TODO.md#open-before-anything-is-submitted).

## Where each change is headed

Per the [branch model](../../README.md#the-branch-model), each of these lives on
a `wip/<base>/<category>` branch, is cherry-picked onto `integration/<base>` — or
onto `debug-int/<base>`, if the category is `debug` — and is distilled into
`submit/<base>/<category>` for the LKML. The device-tree half
of the same work is documented in
[`../device_tree/README.md`](../device_tree/README.md).

As of 2026-07-30 every `submit` branch has an end state **byte-identical** to its
`wip` branch, with one deliberate exception: `submit/7.1.3/sensor` carries **one**
of that category's twelve commits, for the reasons in
[`../sensors/README.md`](../sensors/README.md#why-the-submit-series-is-one-patch).
`camera` goes further and shares its commits with `wip` outright — after the
import split there was nothing left to distil.

### Does any of it apply to a maintainer tree?

All five branches are based on `v7.1.3-r0`, which is an msm8953-mainline release
carrying its own out-of-tree patches — not a tree any maintainer will apply
against. So each group is **trial-rebased onto the tree it would actually be sent
to**, in a throwaway worktree. Re-measured 2026-07-31 against fresh bases —
`broonie/for-next` `b8f7ea37085e` for ASoC, `sre/linux-power-supply` `for-next`
`c57cb36f76eb` for the charger driver, `torvalds/master` `6269cc6f52c6` for
everything else. **Twenty-two of the twenty-seven commits apply with no conflict
at all**, twenty-three after one one-hunk resolution.

| group | target | result |
|---|---|---|
| charger driver + binding | `psy/for-next` | **6 / 6 clean** |
| charger device trees | mainline | **2 / 2 clean** |
| charger `qcom-spmi-adc5` | mainline | **1 / 1 clean** |
| sensor | mainline | **1 / 1 clean** |
| camera device tree | mainline | **1 / 1 clean** |
| camera driver + binding | mainline | one `Kconfig` hunk; **the rest is clean once it is resolved** |
| audio driver + binding | `broonie/for-next` | **11 / 12 clean** — only the machine driver conflicts |
| audio device tree | mainline | conflicts — `&sound_card` does not exist upstream |
| voice | `broonie/for-next` | the file does not exist upstream |

Two rows moved since 2026-07-30, and in opposite directions.

**Audio improved from "conflicts on the first patch" to eleven of twelve.** That
row was measured against a nine-patch series that no longer exists; the binding
was written, and the series was regenerated on 2026-07-31 with the shared-MBHC
work split three ways. Everything in it now applies except the machine driver,
which is the one patch that actually needs the missing prerequisite.

**The camera Kconfig conflict is no longer the IMX355 entry** — it has moved to
`VIDEO_OV9282`, which upstream changed from `depends on OF_GPIO` to
`depends on OF` plus `select V4L2_CCI_I2C`. Same shape, different neighbour: the
conflict follows whichever entry happens to sit next to ours, so the specific
name is not worth remembering. What matters is that it is a single hunk, and that
resolving it in favour of upstream leaves our own entry untouched and the second
camera commit applying cleanly.

☠️ Measured per commit, aborting each failure before the next, so a group's count
is "how many of these apply", not "how far the series gets". Those differ where a
failure cascades: the camera import creating `imx363.c` fails on `Kconfig`, and
without it the delta commit has no file to patch, which reads as **0 / 2** while
the real answer is one trivial hunk. Re-run it after every base bump, and resolve
the first failure before believing the second.

**The charger and the sensor series are therefore ready in the strong sense** —
not merely "the files they touch exist upstream", but "they apply".

The audio conflict is not cosmetic. `qcom,msm8953-qdsp6-sndcard`,
`msm8953_qdsp6_add_ops` and the `use_ibit_clk` field are **not upstream**; they
come from two out-of-tree commits in the base (`4e4cfbe89bbe` by Vldly, 2022, and
`62f07ba624ee` by Alejandro Tafalla, 2023), and our machine-driver patch extends
exactly those structures. The `&sound_card` label the audio DT patch attaches to
does not exist in mainline's `msm8953.dtsi` either. Everything our code *calls* —
`msm8916_qdsp6_startup`/`_shutdown`, the `SLIMBUS_*` DAI IDs — is upstream; it is
the scaffolding that is missing.

That scaffolding **was posted**: Adam Skladowski's *MSM8953/MSM8976 ASoC support*
**v3**, 8 patches, 2024-07-31, still in state `new` — never applied.

* series: <https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/alsa-devel/list/?series=875540>
* cover: `<20240731-msm8953-msm8976-asoc-v3-0-163f23c3a28d@gmail.com>`
* the parts the FP3 audio series needs: 1/8 (Quinary), 5/8 (the
  `msm8953-qdsp6-sndcard` binding), 6/8 (msm8953 machine-driver support)

Because it has a cover letter with a message-id, it is a **citable prerequisite**
— `b4 prep --edit-deps` / a `prerequisite-patch-id:` block, which is how the
kernel expects an unmerged dependency to be declared. The marker tag
[`vendor/asoc-msm8953-base`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/releases/tag/vendor%2Fasoc-msm8953-base)
names the two commits in our base that stand in for it.

The voice series has no such option, and that is written up under
[the voice path](#audio-the-q6-dsp-side).
