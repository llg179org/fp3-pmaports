# Documentation

> ⚠️ **AI-generated.** This page — and the code, device tree and tooling it
> describes — was written by Claude (Opus 5) working under the direction of
> Lajosházi, László Gergely, who reviewed every change and made or reviewed
> every measurement it rests on. Kernel commits carry `Co-authored-by: Claude`;
> anything prepared for the LKML carries `Assisted-by:` instead and never a
> `Signed-off-by` from the assistant, since only a human can certify the DCO.

The [top-level README](../README.md) says what this repository is, how the
branches are named and where the work may go. Everything longer than that lives
here.

If you would rather read the narrative than the reference: **[The story of
making the first phone call with mainline kernel on FP3 with a jacked
headset](first-call/README.md)**.

## How the device works

| page | what it answers |
|---|---|
| [`audio/`](audio/README.md) | how sound gets in and out: the hardware chain, the layers, the two paths (media and call), and the rules the arrangement obeys |
| [`device_tree/`](device_tree/README.md) | which `.dts`/`.dtsi` files the board is built from, what our one commit adds and where every value came from — with the trees themselves checked in, ours and both downstream references |
| [`kernel/`](kernel/README.md) | the eleven files we change: whose driver each one is, what we added on top and what genuinely did not exist before — plus what every checker says about the submit series |
| [`camera/`](camera/README.md) | the Sony IMX363 rear sensor and its AK7374 focus motor: what is wired, what streams, how to check it — with the investigation in [`camera/bringup/`](camera/bringup/README.md) |
| [`charger/`](charger/README.md) | the PMI632 charger: what makes it charge, what makes it *stop*, the JEITA and thermal guards that let it charge harder, and why the ceiling is the USB port rather than the battery — with the investigation in [`charger/bringup/`](charger/bringup/README.md) |
| [`sensors/`](sensors/README.md) | the proximity / ambient-light / IMU bring-up, which runs through the SSC — working, with calibration left |
| [`power/`](power/README.md) | what the phone actually draws, measured against the vendor stack on the same hardware: the idle figures, the ~100 mA the held-open camera costs, and every raw capture the charger work rests on — with the investigation in [`power/bringup/`](power/bringup/README.md) |
| [`sailfish-native/`](sailfish-native/README.md) | whether a **native** Sailfish — Lipstick on the mainline kernel and Mesa, no hybris — is reachable on this device: the two measurements that decide it, and the answer |
| [`debug/`](debug/README.md) | the bring-up safety net: the watchdog started at probe, why there is no ramoops, and where the debugging *method* lives — with [`debug/create_debug.md`](debug/create_debug.md), the step-by-step for building that safety net onto any branch from scratch |

## What is still open

[`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) is the **live** page — what the device is running right
now, the branch tips, and the work queue in the order it should be worked. Read
it first; it is rewritten as the work happens, so it is the newest thing here and
also the thinnest.

Then two lists, on different axes, and it is worth knowing which one you want:

* [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) — **the authoritative one**, organised by item: what was
  measured, what is parked and why, plus the settled questions kept as a record
  so nobody re-investigates them. Items already written up on a subsystem page
  are linked rather than repeated.
* [`FP3-TODO.md`](FP3-TODO.md) — the same ground organised **by branch**: which
  branch owns which open item, where the work may be sent at all, which series
  applies to which maintainer tree, and the `vendor/*` / `archive/*` namespaces.
  It flattens back in what `TODO.md` links out, so read it when the question is
  *"what is the state of this branch"* rather than *"what is left to do"*. When
  the two disagree, `TODO.md` wins.

Both live here and nowhere else. Until 2026-07-30 `FP3-TODO.md` also shipped at
the root of the kernel fork, as a byte-identical copy kept in sync by hand; it
was dropped there because the kernel tree should carry kernel source, and one
file in two repositories is one file too many to keep honest.

## How to work on it

| page | what it answers |
|---|---|
| [`deploy/`](deploy/README.md) | building the package and getting it onto the phone, keeping the last working kernel bootable — including the device-tree-only shortcut |
| [`rolling-a-new-base.md`](rolling-a-new-base.md) | moving the whole port to a new `msm8953-mainline` release: the checkouts, the rebases, the one place the version is edited |
| [`moving-to-the-org.md`](moving-to-the-org.md) | transferring the three repositories to another GitHub owner: the order that avoids a broken window, and the five references that are not merely prose |
| [`kernel/config.md`](kernel/config.md) | what [`config-fp3.aarch64`](../linux-fp3/config-fp3.aarch64) turns on beyond the postmarketOS base, and the symbol renames that silently drop a driver across a base bump |

Two more places worth knowing about: [`../tests/`](../tests/) holds
`fp3-selftest`, the functional regression battery, and
[`../userspace-audio/`](../userspace-audio/) the UCM profiles, PulseAudio
drop-ins and call-audio helpers that the audio page describes.

## What is deliberately not here

**Method.** How to form a hardware hypothesis, which instrument answers which
question, the brick-safety rules, the traps that cost a build cycle — those live
in the [FP3 skills](https://github.com/llg179org/Claude-skills-Fairphone3), because
they outlive this device. These pages answer *what is true now*; the skills
answer *how to find out*, and their `references/archive/` keeps the dated
investigation logs that answer *was this already tried*.

The split has a test. **Would it be wrong next month?** Then it is status, and it
belongs here. **Would it still be true on a different phone?** Then it is method,
and it belongs in the skill.
