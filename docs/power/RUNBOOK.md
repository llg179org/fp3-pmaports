**This file is the resume point.** It is rewritten whenever the state changes, so
that a context compaction — or a new session — costs nothing. Read it first, do
what "Next step" says, then update it. Everything else on this page ages out;
the reasoning lives in [`bringup/`](bringup/README.md) and the findings in
[`README.md`](README.md).

## Where the question stands

The search moved three times on 2026-08-14 and landed outside this SoC:

1. *Does a suspend reach the RPM?* — wrong level.
2. *Does anything notify the RPM?* — nothing did; mainline msm8953 described no
   MPM. Added, and the notification demonstrably runs.
3. *Why does the governor never select the deepest cluster state?* — **answered**:
   `genpd_governor_data::cached_power_down_state_idx` is declared `bool`, so a
   cached state index of 2 comes back as 1 and the search, which only walks
   downwards, can never reach index 2 again. Six years old, not msm8953-specific.
   Fixed; `cluster-pc` 0 → 14516 per minute, `system-pc` 0 → 3531. Written up in
   [`README.md`](README.md) under "The real cause".
4. **Current: the RPM still records nothing.** `qcom_stats` `vlow`/`vmin` are 0
   and the APSS master record is all zeros, while the AP now completes a
   system-level power collapse ~47 times a second. The question is now the RPM
   handshake alone.

## Next step

★★★ **Answered: with the display genuinely off, the genpd fix is worth ~9 %.**
Two legs per arm, fresh boot each, 200 samples after a 300 s settle, display gate
enforced: **−119.0 mA with the fix, −130.5 mA without**, arms non-overlapping.
The earlier panel-on set had the opposite sign and was also correct - it was a
different regime, not noise. Full write-up in [`README.md`](README.md), data in
[`2026-08-15_ab-current-legs.txt`](2026-08-15_ab-current-legs.txt).

**Baseline to attack next: ~130 mA idle with the screen off.** The instrument is
`docs/power/idle-leg.sh` (copy it to `/home/fp3/` and run as root); it suspends
USBIN so nothing needs unplugging, gates on the display really being off, and
restores the charger on every exit path.

**The obvious next question, and it is cheap:** bisect that 130 mA by subsystem
with the same instrument - one leg with WiFi down, one with the modem stopped,
one with `pd-mapper` disabled. Each is a leg, each is ten minutes, and the
instrument now resolves ~7 mA comfortably.

**The RPM question is parked, not open.** Every AP-side precondition is verified
and the two-sided vMPM dump is structurally identical; what remains is past the
PSCI call, in TZ or RPM firmware, where this kernel has no instrument.

**Upstream:** the genpd patch can now say plainly that it measurably improves
idle current on an SDM632 phone. The cpuidle-psci ordering patch is unaffected.
The vMPM timer commit (`wip/7.1.3/power` `97951baf7a85`) stays on the fork - it is
a real omission but still changes nothing measurable.

**Also still open:** GPIO wakeup map inert until the RPM takes over; the regulator
sleep set must exist *before* the RPM ever collapses; `_commit`/`pkgrel` still pin
`162f27abc328` and should move to the current `debug-int/7.1.3` tip.

☠️ **Two traps this cost:** never reboot with USBIN suspended (the bit is in the
PMIC, survives a warm reboot, and wedged the bootloader into a fastboot that
answered nothing - it took a held power button). And `systemctl stop greetd`
returns before the compositor releases DRM master, so a single write to
`fb0/blank` is silently undone.

## Device and tree state

* Phone on `slot_b`, running a hand-deployed `Image` from `debug-int/7.1.3`
  `6fd035d9501a` (build #18, `/home/fp3/Image.fix`; the A/B control is
  `/home/fp3/Image.control`, the same tree with 162f27abc328 reverted),
  not a package build. Backups in `/boot`: `vmlinuz.pre-mpmtimer`,
  `vmlinuz.genpdfix`, `vmlinuz.base-mpm`, `vmlinuz.pre-mpm`.
* The oracle is `slot_a` (Ubuntu Touch); `fastboot set_active a|b` switches, and
  `ut-ssh` reaches it.
* Kernel work is the `power` category: `wip/7.1.3/power` → `integration/7.1.3` →
  `debug-int/7.1.3`, all pushed to `fork`.
* **A package build has not been run for any of this**, so `_commit` in
  `linux-fp3/APKBUILD` still predates it. Do that before calling anything
  shipped.

## Instruments, with the paths that cost time to find

| question | command |
|---|---|
| did the SoC reach a low-power mode | `grep Count /sys/kernel/debug/qcom_stats/{vlow,vmin}` |
| which master never goes down | `cat /sys/kernel/debug/qcom_rpm_master_stats/APSS` — ☠️ one file per master, and the directory is `qcom_rpm_master_stats`, not `rpm_master_stats`; needs `modprobe rpm_master_stats` |
| how deep does idle actually get | `cat /sys/kernel/debug/pm_genpd/power-domain-cluster0/idle_states` |
| the same on the oracle | `ut-ssh 'cat /sys/kernel/debug/rpm_master_stats'` and `.../lpm_stats/stats` |
| what is waking the CPUs | two `/proc/interrupts` snapshots differenced — ☠️ stop the compositor first, or `msm_mdss` at 65/s makes the run meaningless |
