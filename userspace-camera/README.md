What the kernel side does and what is measured live in
[`../docs/camera/README.md`](../docs/camera/README.md); how it was found out is
in [`../docs/camera/bringup/README.md`](../docs/camera/bringup/README.md). This
directory holds the two tools that need a scene in front of the lens — which is
why they are not part of the `fp3-selftest` battery — and the patches that make
a camera app usable on this phone.

## The patches

Neither is a device quirk: both fix something missing for every device of their
kind, and both are written to be offered upstream.

| patch | what it adds |
|---|---|
| [`libcamera/0100-add-imx363-sensor-helper.patch`](libcamera/0100-add-imx363-sensor-helper.patch) | the **sensor helper** for the IMX363, without which libipa has no analogue-gain model or black level for it: `AnalogueGainLinear{ 0, 512, -1, 512 }` — the IMX214's model — and `blackLevel_ = 4096`, i.e. 64 at 10 bits |
| [`libcamera/0101-simple-autofocus.patch`](libcamera/0101-simple-autofocus.patch) | contrast-detection **autofocus** for libcamera's `simple` pipeline: a sharpness statistic in the software ISP's existing stats pass, accumulated into a 5×5 zone grid; an `Af` algorithm in the simple IPA; and the focus lens plumbed through the way the IPU3 handler does it. Publishes `AfMode`, `AfTrigger`, `AfMetering`, `AfWindows` |
| [`libcamera/0102-ipa-simple-Allow-the-exposure-time-and-the-gain-to-b.patch`](libcamera/0102-ipa-simple-Allow-the-exposure-time-and-the-gain-to-b.patch) | **manual exposure and gain**: `ExposureTimeMode` / `AnalogueGainMode` and their values. The two are independent — with the exposure held, a darkening scene is answered with gain, and the other way round |
| [`libcamera/0103-ipa-simple-Allow-the-white-balance-to-be-set.patch`](libcamera/0103-ipa-simple-Allow-the-white-balance-to-be-set.patch) | **manual white balance**: `AwbEnable` plus a settable `ColourTemperature`, and `rgbFromCCT()` in libipa to convert one into gains |
| [`libcamera/0104-ipa-simple-Allow-the-focus-to-be-set-where-the-lens-.patch`](libcamera/0104-ipa-simple-Allow-the-focus-to-be-set-where-the-lens-.patch) | **manual focus**: `LensPosition` in dioptres — advertised only where the tuning file relates actuator codes to distances, which [`imx363.yaml`](libcamera/imx363.yaml) now does. ☠️ Correct on its own and **inert in combination with `0101`** until libcamera r13: `0101` clamps in `moveTo()` against members that only `startScan()` fills, and this patch's manual path never calls it, so every request landed on code 0. Fixed by clamping against `context.lens` |
| [`libcamera/imx363.yaml`](libcamera/imx363.yaml) | the tuning file that turns `Af` on for this sensor, and — via `lens-infinity-code` / `lens-closest-code` / `lens-closest-distance` — relates actuator codes to distances so `LensPosition` can be published. The dioptre scale is an **estimate**, not a calibration |
| [`snapshot/0001-camera-inhibit-idle-while-viewfinder-active.patch`](snapshot/0001-camera-inhibit-idle-while-viewfinder-active.patch) | keeps the screen from blanking while the viewfinder is open, not only while recording ([GNOME/snapshot!461](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/snapshot/-/merge_requests/461)) |
| [`snapshot/0002-camera-zoom.patch`](snapshot/0002-camera-zoom.patch) | **zoom** by pinch, scroll wheel or double tap, on `camerabin`'s own `zoom` property, so the saved picture is zoomed exactly as it was framed |
| [`snapshot/0003-camera-viewfinder-resolution.patch`](snapshot/0003-camera-viewfinder-resolution.patch) | takes the picture at the **sensor's resolution** and previews at a smaller one, switching the source between them for the shot — the way Megapixels does it — and drops the preview a step when fewer than 20 fps actually arrive |
| [`snapshot/0004-camera-tap-to-focus.patch`](snapshot/0004-camera-tap-to-focus.patch) | an **autofocus switch** in the preferences; with it off, one tap focuses and two focus and shoot. Reaches the control through `pw-cli set-param`, because `pipewiresrc` carries no camera controls |
| [`snapshot/0005-camera-manual-controls.patch`](snapshot/0005-camera-manual-controls.patch) | a preferences group where **every control the camera publishes** can be taken over — exposure, gain, white balance, contrast, gamma. The rows are built from what `pw-dump` reports, not from a list in the source, so a control the app has never heard of still gets a working row |
| [`snapshot/0006-camera-preview-resolution-choice.patch`](snapshot/0006-camera-preview-resolution-choice.patch) | lets the **viewfinder resolution** be chosen and remembers it, so the search for a size that streams is not repeated every start |
| [`snapshot/0007-camera-only-set-controls-that-exist.patch`](snapshot/0007-camera-only-set-controls-that-exist.patch) | never writes a control the camera does not publish |
| [`snapshot/0008-camera-pan-the-zoomed-viewfinder.patch`](snapshot/0008-camera-pan-the-zoomed-viewfinder.patch) | **aims the zoom**: drag the viewfinder to move the framed window. Moves the zoom off camerabin's centre-only crop onto a `videocrop` inside the source bin, upstream of the tee, so the still and the video are cropped exactly as framed |
| [`snapshot/0009-gallery-zoom-and-pan.patch`](snapshot/0009-gallery-zoom-and-pan.patch) | **zoom and pan in the viewer**: pinch, scroll or double tap a saved picture and drag it around, so a shot can be checked for sharpness without leaving the app. Claims the drag only while magnified, leaving the gallery's swipe intact at fit size |
| [`snapshot/0010-camera-flash-mode.patch`](snapshot/0010-camera-flash-mode.patch) | **the flash**, which Snapshot has no control for at all: off, automatic and always, as a menu button beside the countdown one. Driven as a torch through the kernel's LED flash class, found by the class's own attributes rather than by name, so a machine without one shows no button. The light comes on 600 ms **before** the capture, because a torch lit with the shutter is metered as though it were not there |

| [`snapshot/0011-camera-resolution-and-flash-focus.patch`](snapshot/0011-camera-resolution-and-flash-focus.patch) | **the viewfinder no longer measures the camera at startup.** It starts on the offered size closest to the screen and remembers it; measuring is a *Find Best Size* row in the preferences, and only when asked. When it does measure, it keeps the **largest** size that stays smooth rather than the smallest that streams — buffers counted over the settling window are a frame rate, so the probe that was already running is the measurement. Also stops a resolution change from looking like a broken camera — a pipeline error while one is in flight goes back to the last size that delivered frames instead of reaching the user as *"Could not play camera stream"*, and the idle inhibitor is no longer released on every reconfiguration. Adds a **photo resolution** of its own and a **JPEG quality** with an estimate of what a picture costs at it, and makes a flash photograph **focus again once the light is on**. A second shot fired while the capture's own resolution switch is still restoring the preview no longer waits out a fixed budget into a dead pipeline - it is refused immediately, as *not ready*, and the shutter is re-enabled right away instead of staying disabled forever |

They are applied by the `libcamera` and `snapshot` aports in the pmaports
checkout; the copies here are the source of truth for this port.

The `libcamera` aport needs two more changes, which are not patches:
`mesa-dev` in `makedepends` and `-Dsoftisp-gpu=enabled` in `build()`. Without
them libcamera builds only the CPU debayer, which **centre-crops** instead of
scaling — a 1920×1080 preview then shows less than half the sensor's width, and
looks like a camera stuck at 3× zoom.

The `snapshot` patches need nothing extra from the aport, but the tap-to-focus
one needs **`pw-cli` on the device** (it is in the `pipewire-tools` package). It
sets the camera's controls by running that tool, because GStreamer's
`pipewiresrc` carries none of them.

☠️ **The in-process alternative was tried first and abandoned: the `pipewire`
Rust crate cannot be cross compiled here.** Its `libspa-sys` runs bindgen, which
`dlopen`s libclang from the *build script* — a binary of the build host's
architecture, run inside the target's chroot. Neither libclang works: the
target's is the wrong architecture for the loader, and the native one, reached
through `/native`, is the wrong architecture for the process. Forking `pw-cli`
costs one process per focus request and no build dependency at all.

☠️ **After upgrading libcamera, restart the PipeWire stack.** A running
`wireplumber` holds the old library while the new IPA is loaded from disk, and
the mismatch shows up as *"no camera found"* in every app —
`systemctl --user restart wireplumber pipewire` fixes it.

## The tools

| tool | what it answers |
|---|---|
| [`focus-sweep.py`](focus-sweep.py) | does the lens move, and where in the control range this scene comes into focus — headless, prints numbers |
| [`focus-view.py`](focus-view.py) | what the lens is doing *right now*, to a human — a live viewfinder with a focus slider, the same sharpness number, and zoom |
| [`flash-check.py`](flash-check.py) | does the flash actually put light on the scene — the camera as the photometer, torch toggled under one held capture |
| [`stream-restart-test.sh`](stream-restart-test.sh) | how many times the camera stream can be reconfigured before it stops answering — headless, no camera app, no screen |
| [`resolution-sweep.sh`](resolution-sweep.sh) | which viewfinder sizes a running camera app can actually stream, one at a time |

The two `focus-*` tools open `/dev/video0` **exclusively**, so they cannot run at
the same time as each other or alongside a camera app. The two `.sh` ones are the
opposite: `stream-restart-test.sh` needs the camera *free*, and
`resolution-sweep.sh` needs a camera app holding it and visible on screen.

☠️ **`resolution-sweep.sh` is the one to read before writing another
measurement here**, not because of what it measures but because of the two ways
it has already been wrong. It once reported all 47 sizes working, from an
application that had never opened a camera — silence read as success. Rebuilt to
demand positive evidence, it then reported nine sizes broken, all nine of which
were merely the ones tried after the screen blanked and took the stream with it.
Both guards it now carries — the screen check and the control size re-measured
after every failure — exist because the sweep had already produced a confident
answer without them.

## `focus-sweep.py`

Steps `V4L2_CID_FOCUS_ABSOLUTE` across a range and scores each position for
sharpness. Run it on the device, pointed at something with detail:

```sh
focus-sweep.py                                 # full range, 9 positions, 4 passes
focus-sweep.py --lo 280 --hi 480 --passes 6    # zoom in on the peak
focus-sweep.py --steps 17 --keep /tmp/sweep
```

A working actuator produces a curve with a single interior peak; it prints every
pass, the spread within each position and the drift between passes, so the
verdict can be checked instead of taken.

☠️ **Two properties of the method are load-bearing, and each one cost a
confidently wrong answer on this phone:**

- **One capture is held open for the whole run.** Restarting the stream per
  position resets auto-exposure and injects a settling transient as large as the
  effect being measured. That produced "the lens does not move" from a lens that
  moves.
- **The positions are visited in interleaved passes of alternating direction.**
  A single ordered walk confounds position with time, and anything drifting
  during the run comes out as a smooth curve that looks like one side of a peak.
  That produced "the lens moves" before it had been shown to.

Two things about the metric worth knowing before trusting a number from it:

- ☠️ **The gradient is taken between pixel *x* and *x+2*, never between
  neighbours.** The frames are raw Bayer, so adjacent pixels are different
  colour planes and their difference measures the scene's colour rather than the
  focus. That mistake produces a large, stable, entirely meaningless number.
- **Only the high byte of each pixel is used.** Frames arrive MIPI-packed
  (`pRAA`): four pixels in five bytes, the fifth holding their low bits.
  Dropping it costs two bits and buys a large speed-up on a 15 MB frame.

The lens subdev is found by looking for the control, never by device index — the
`/dev/v4l-subdev*` numbering moves between boots.

## `focus-view.py`

A viewfinder that owns the camera itself: a GTK4 window with a focus slider
(plus ±1/±10 buttons), the sharpness number the sweep uses printed live, a 1–16×
zoom by slider or pinch, a cheap demosaic and a rotate button.

```sh
# from an SSH session, so it survives the session closing
systemd-run --user --unit=focus-view /usr/bin/python3 ./focus-view.py
systemctl --user stop focus-view
```

It exists because the two other instruments each answered half the question: the
sweep measures well but shows nothing, so a null result is hard to trust, and a
camera app shows a picture but scales it down far enough to hide the change. The
focus effect on this phone was invisible at 1× and obvious at 8×.

What it is **not** is a camera app: it debayers by taking one 2×2 RGGB quad per
output pixel (half resolution, no interpolation), white-balances by grey world
and applies a fixed gamma. That is deliberately the cheapest correct pipeline
that still shows detail honestly — the picture a proper camera app produces goes
through libcamera's software ISP instead and will not match it.
