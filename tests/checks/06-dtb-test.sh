# Description: the booted device tree is the one the kernel package shipped
#
# The module tree already has this guard (05-modules, "module tree matches the
# installed package"). The device tree had none, and it is the easier of the two
# to get wrong, because a DTB is cheap to build from any checkout: the host
# `make qcom/<board>.dtb` takes seconds and writes a file that looks exactly as
# legitimate as the packaged one.
#
# It cost a session on 2026-08-01. A DTB built in a worktree parked on
# wip/<base>/camera was copied to /boot; that branch carries the base plus the
# camera commits and nothing else, so the deployed tree silently lost the audio,
# voice, charger, sensor and debug layers. The visible symptom was the battery
# reading 0% - not because the battery was flat (it was at 91% and charging) but
# because charger@1000 was absent, so no pmi632-battery power supply was ever
# created and there was nobody to ask. The deployed file had been md5-verified,
# but against the worktree it came from rather than against the package, so the
# check passed and proved nothing.
#
# Both directions of the same mistake are now covered:
#   this check          -> a hand-deployed DTB replaced the package's
#   40-camera, step 1   -> the package's DTB replaced a hand-deployed one
#                          (an apk operation fires the mkinitfs trigger)
#
# Two questions, deliberately separate. The md5 is the invariant; the marker
# nodes say *which* layer went missing, which is what turns "wrong DTB" into a
# one-line diagnosis instead of a decompile.

# ☠️ The deploy convention keeps several kernels in /boot at once by suffixing
# each DTB with the package release it belongs to (….dtb-r81) or with a role
# (….dtb-fallback). The PACKAGE ships the unsuffixed name, so the lookup below
# has to strip the suffix - without this the check reports "installs no
# <name>.dtb-r81" on every correctly deployed phone, which reads like a missing
# DTB and is a naming mismatch in the check itself. Measured 2026-09-05.
# The md5 comparison is unaffected: the deployed copy must still be byte-for-
# byte the package's file, which is exactly what it is copied from.
