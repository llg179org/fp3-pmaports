# Description: the PMI632 flash LED probes, and the torch really draws current
#
# Whether the LED emits light is the one thing this cannot see, so it is not
# what is measured here. Two things that can be measured stand in for it: the
# PMIC's own channel-enable and target-current registers have to show the
# hardware actually programmed, and the input current has to rise when the
# torch is switched on. A driver that returned success without touching the
# part would pass neither.
#
# ☠️ The battery is the wrong ammeter, twice over. pmi632-battery exposes no
# current_now at all - the charger driver does not implement the property - and
# with a cable attached the torch is fed from USB, so battery voltage does not
# droop even when the LED is at full current. Reading battery voltage said "no
# current flows" about a flash that was visibly lit. Use the PMIC's USB input
# current ADC, and interleave the states, because a single on/off pair is
# swamped by the noise on that channel.
#
# For an optical confirmation, which needs a scene and so cannot live in an
# unattended battery, see userspace-camera/flash-check.py: it holds one capture
# open and switches the torch underneath it.

# distrusting. Measured 2026-08-16: the channel is on iio:device0
# (200f000.spmi:pmic@2:adc@3100) and device1 is the other PMIC's ADC, which has
# no such channel at all. The index moves between boots, so match on the
