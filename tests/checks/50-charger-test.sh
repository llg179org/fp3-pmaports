# Category: charger
# Requires: cable
# Description: the PMI632 charger reports sane values and actually charges
#
# Reading "status = Charging" only proves the driver saw a cable. Whether
# current is flowing is a different question, and it is the one that matters:
# a charger driver can enumerate perfectly and still deliver nothing. So this
# check watches the battery over a short window instead of taking one reading.
