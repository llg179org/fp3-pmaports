# Description: a tone played on the speaker is heard by the handset mic
#
# Opt-in, and deliberately not part of the default gate. The medium is the air
# in the room, so the result depends on the volume, on whether the phone is
# lying face-down, and on whether anyone is talking nearby - and it makes an
# audible noise every run. A gate that goes red for those reasons stops being
# believed within a fortnight, which is worse than not having it.
#
# When it does run it is the strongest audio evidence there is: a pass proves
# the entire chain, codec to speaker to microphone to codec, end to end.
