The postmarketOS package that builds the Fairphone 3 mainline kernel — mainline
`msm8953` with the WCD9335 SLIMbus audio work, the Sony IMX363 rear camera, the
PMI632 charger and the sensors the SSC keeps behind a QMI service.

Without this, the [kernel branches](https://github.com/llg179org/linux) are only
source: nothing records which config was used, which symbols had to be turned
on by hand, or how the thing was actually built.

**[The story of making the first phone call with mainline kernel on FP3 with a
jacked headset](docs/first-call/README.md)** — a four-year-old bug, the three
small things that turned out to cause it, the thirty-two measurements that
missed them, and where the fix may go.

## The goal, and why the names have no version in them

[`llg179org/linux`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux) is a **rolling forward-port**
of Fairphone 3 support onto the
latest [`msm8953-mainline`](https://github.com/msm8953-mainline/linux) release
(`X.Y.Z/main`), kept moving from one kernel base to the next until the work
lands upstream on the LKML.

Because the base keeps changing, the kernel version is deliberately confined to
the **two places where it is genuinely the identity of something**:

* the base segment of a base-relative branch — `wip/7.1.3/audio`,
  `submit/7.1.3/audio`, `integration/7.1.3` — a patch series *is* "the series
  against 7.1.3", so the version belongs in the name, and the old ones are
  pruned once a base is retired; and
* the package `pkgver`.

Everything else — the package name `linux-fp3`, its flavor `fp3`, the config
`config-fp3.aarch64`, the test suite, the boot entries — carries **no version**.
Bumping `pkgver` is the single edit that moves the whole thing to a new kernel.

## The branch model

For a base `X.Y.Z` there are four layers, each base-relative:

| branch | layer | contents |
|---|---|---|
| `X.Y.Z/main` | base | the upstream `msm8953-mainline` release; not ours to rename, we just follow the newest |
| `wip/X.Y.Z/<category>` | work | the category's commits rebased onto the base, **plus the bump fixes** — messy, evolving history |
| `integration/X.Y.Z` | build | the cherry-pick union of the **upstream-bound** `wip/X.Y.Z/*` branches — audio, voice, camera, charger, sensor, power. Versioned so the last working `integration/<prev>` survives while the new base is still being fixed |
| `debug-int/X.Y.Z` | build | `integration/X.Y.Z` plus the `debug` layer; **this is what the package builds** |
| `submit/X.Y.Z/<category>` | upstream | the **minimal** series distilled from `wip/X.Y.Z/<category>` — created only once everything works, ready to post to the LKML |

Replaying the debug layer onto any other branch — an experimental offshoot is
exactly where an early hang is likely — is one command from the target branch:

```sh
git am ../fp3-pmaports/docs/debug/files/0001-watchdog-qcom-optionally-start-the-watchdog-at-probe.patch
```

The step-by-step, including what to do when that patch stops applying, is
[`docs/debug/create_debug.md`](docs/debug/create_debug.md).

It applies clean because the debug board nodes live in their own
`sdm632-fairphone-fp3-debug.dtsi`, pulled in by a single `#include` among the
other includes. Every category appends to the *end* of
`sdm632-fairphone-fp3.dts`, so a debug block that appended there too collided
with whichever of them was present — measured 2026-07-30, the old form conflicted
on `audio` and on `integration` and applied clean on `camera` and `charger`,
while the split form applies clean on all five wip branches and on integration.

The last two are split for one reason each. `integration` stays free of the debug
layer so that it remains a faithful preview of what the `submit` branches carry —
it is the branch you compare against when you want to know whether the port and
the proposed series still say the same thing. `debug-int` is what gets flashed,
because the safety net has to be on the phone: without the watchdog running from
probe, a hang before userspace opens `/dev/watchdog` leaves a device that only a
physical button press recovers, and this one is usually not at arm's reach.

A category is one subsystem's worth of work — the unit a `submit` series is cut
from, where there is going to be one. There are six:

| category | what it adds | `submit` series |
|---|---|---|
| `audio` | WCD9335 over SLIMbus: playback, the four digital mics, headset (MBHC) jack detection | yes |
| `voice` | call audio, by routing the voice mixers over SLIMbus | yes |
| `camera` | the Sony IMX363 rear sensor | yes |
| `charger` | the PMI632 charger via `qcom_smbx`: the battery thermistor, hardware JEITA, thermal mitigation and a device-tree-driven charge current ([`docs/charger/`](docs/charger/README.md)) | yes |
| `sensor` | proximity, ambient light and the IMU, over the SSC's QMI Sensor Manager | **one patch of twelve** — the imported base cannot carry a DCO and its author's own series is in flight ([why](docs/sensors/README.md#why-the-submit-series-is-one-patch)) |
| `power` | the platform's own low-power plumbing and the instruments that measure it: the RPM sleep-stats region and the per-master sleep records ([`docs/power/`](docs/power/README.md)) | not yet — the description patches are upstream material, the fix they point at is not written |
| `debug` | the bring-up safety net and nothing else: the SoC watchdog started at probe, so a hung boot resets instead of waiting for hands ([`docs/debug/`](docs/debug/README.md)) | never — deliberately not upstream material. **The only category with no `wip` branch:** one commit on `debug-int/<base>`, reproducible from [`docs/debug/files/`](docs/debug/files/) without any branch at all |

Reading it: "what runs on the phone" is always `debug-int/<pkgver>`; "what the
series will look like" is always `integration/<pkgver>`; "what goes to the
kernel" is always `submit/<pkgver>/<category>`; the base version is the only
thing that changes.

A `wip/<base>/<category>-debug` branch is something else again: an ephemeral
offshoot for one investigation, not a category, and not cherry-picked anywhere.
It is deleted when the investigation ends — and if any of its commits are worth
keeping reachable, tagged first, the way `archive/cx-turbo-disproven` keeps the
disproven CX-turbo experiment after `wip/7.1.3/audio-debug` was removed on
2026-07-30.

Two more namespaces exist on the kernel fork and neither is a base for anything:

* **`vendor/*`** — archival snapshots of third-party code this port imports or
  builds on, so that a provenance citation in a commit message still resolves
  when the original repository is gone. `vendor/imx363-sdm670` is the IMX363
  driver as Joel Selvaraj wrote it; `vendor/q6voice-sdm670` is the further
  developed q6voice stack from the same tree. Each is a **parentless snapshot**
  whose tree is byte-identical to the source commit's, because mirroring the real
  branch would have dragged 71 541 unrelated commits into this fork. The tags
  `vendor/asoc-msm8953-base` and `vendor/q6voice-base` do the same job for
  dependencies that already sit inside `7.1.3/main` — they name them, nothing
  more.
* **`archive/*`** tags — points in this port's own history kept reachable after a
  rewrite, either because a claim they contain was disproven or because something
  still points at them. `archive/integration-7.1.3-pre-camera-provenance` and
  `archive/integration-7.1.3-pre-debug-split` are the latter: each is a tip that
  an older `_commit` is only reachable through, and without them the package's
  pinned tarball would have become un-fetchable when `integration/7.1.3` was
  rewritten.

☠️ **Rewriting a published branch can break the package, silently and later.**
`linux-fp3/APKBUILD` fetches a GitHub tarball of an exact `_commit`, and GitHub
serves that only while the commit is reachable from *some* ref. Before any
force-push that rewrites `integration/<base>`, tag the old tip — then check the
pin still resolves:

```sh
curl -sI -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \
  "https://github.com/llg179org/linux/archive/<_commit>.tar.gz"     # 302, not 404
```

**The category rule (version-free):** a change lands on `wip/X.Y.Z/<category>`
**and** is cherry-picked onto `integration/X.Y.Z`. The two never diverge;
integration is only ever the sum of the `wip` branches that feed it. `debug` is
the exception in both halves: it has no `wip` branch, so a debug change is
committed straight onto `debug-int/X.Y.Z`, and the stored payloads under
[`docs/debug/files/`](docs/debug/files/) are refreshed in the same breath —
those, not a branch, are what make the layer reproducible. `submit/X.Y.Z/<category>` is regenerated from `wip` when the base is
done; it is not edited by hand.

☠️ *"Not edited by hand"* is the part that slips. Both the charger and the audio
series picked up `checkpatch --strict` fixes directly on their `submit` branch,
which left `wip` behind — so regenerating, which is how a submit branch is
*supposed* to be produced, would have silently dropped them. Both were carried
back on 2026-07-30, and the check is one command: `git diff wip/<base>/<cat>
submit/<base>/<cat>` must be empty.

The two-base worked example, how `wip` and `submit` diverge on a messy bump, and
why `integration` is versioned at all are in
[`docs/rolling-a-new-base.md`](docs/rolling-a-new-base.md#the-model-this-procedure-moves)
— that page is this model in motion.

## Rolling to a new kernel base

When `msm8953-mainline` cuts a new release, the whole procedure — setting the
three checkouts up, rebasing each `wip` branch, rebuilding `integration`, the
one place the version is edited, and pruning the old base — is in
**[`docs/rolling-a-new-base.md`](docs/rolling-a-new-base.md)**.

Two traps it opens with, because both cost an afternoon the first time: the base
branch names contain a slash, so `git fetch origin '7.2.0/main'` leaves you with
`FETCH_HEAD` and no `origin/7.2.0/main` ref; and a shallow clone answers
`git log -- <path>` with one commit for every path, which looks like an answer.


## Building and deploying

`pmbootstrap` builds the package, the `.apk` is copied to the phone and
installed, and the previous kernel stays bootable as a second `extlinux` entry
while the new one is tried — including the device-tree-only shortcut that needs
no kernel flash. All of it, with the fallback-entry setup and the recovery
paths, is in **[`docs/deploy/README.md`](docs/deploy/README.md)**.


## The config

`linux-fp3/config-fp3.aarch64`, what has to be on for this device, and the
symbol renames that silently drop a driver across a base bump:
**[`docs/kernel/config.md`](docs/kernel/config.md)**.

## AI-assisted development

### What was written here, and what it builds on

Almost nothing here is new code in isolation: every module is somebody else's
driver with a Fairphone 3 shaped hole filled in.
**[`docs/kernel/README.md`](docs/kernel/README.md)** says per file whose work it
is, what we added and what that was derived from, and what genuinely did not
exist before — the same treatment
[`docs/device_tree/README.md`](docs/device_tree/README.md) gives the `.dts`.

In short. Audio and charger are eleven files of other people's drivers with holes
filled in: the WCD9335 codec and the `apq8016_sbc` machine driver (Srinivas
Kandagatla), the Q6 voice DAI (Stephan Gerhold, Vincent Knecht, Otto Pflüger —
not in Linus' tree) and `q6afe` (Kandagatla), the SMB2 charger driver and its
binding (Casey Connolly), and the PMIC ADC5 driver (Siddartha Mohanadoss).
**The camera and the sensors are imports**, and that is the more delicate case:
the IMX363 driver is **Joel Selvaraj's**, reverse-engineered on
`sdm670-mainline/linux` against a Pixel-3a-family sensor, and the sensor stack is
Yassine Oudjana's QRTR-bus and Sensor Manager series — both **carried verbatim**
so the authorship survives. On top of the sensor import are three new drivers and
four fixes; on top of the camera import, four power-path changes (+68 / −21 on a
1514-line file) and nothing else. Both splits are spelled out per file —
[`docs/kernel/README.md`](docs/kernel/README.md#provenance) and
[`docs/sensors/README.md`](docs/sensors/README.md#provenance).

☠️ This page and the kernel page both **described the camera driver as
substantially ours until 2026-07-30**, and so did the commit message on
`submit/7.1.3/camera`. All three are corrected: the import is now
[its own commit](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/cda174905a83) authored by
Joel Selvaraj, carrying the original `Signed-off-by` chain, with our change on top
of it. It is worth knowing *why* it stood so long — the wrong claim was
self-consistent and nobody had tried to fetch the original file. The check that
broke it is cheap and should be routine: **get the upstream file and diff it.**
**Everything this port adds on top was developed with the assistance of
[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)**, Anthropic's generative-AI
coding agent.

### How the assistance is recorded

Every commit on this repository and on the `wip`/`integration` branches carries
a `Co-authored-by: Claude` trailer. The `submit` branches, which are meant for
the kernel, instead carry the kernel's `Assisted-by: Claude:<model>` trailer and
**no** `Signed-off-by` from the AI — a DCO sign-off is a human certification and
an AI cannot give one.

### Where it may and may not go

Because of the AI assistance, **this code must not be submitted or upstreamed to
postmarketOS.** postmarketOS's
[AI policy](https://docs.postmarketos.org/policies-and-processes/development/ai-policy.html)
forbids the use of generative AI tools in the project — *"We forbid the use of
generative AI tools in postmarketOS"* — and specifically prohibits "submitting
contributions fully or in part created by generative AI tools". This repository
and the linked kernel branches are a personal fork for running mainline on the
Fairphone 3; they are deliberately kept out of the postmarketOS contribution
channels for this reason. The LKML, whose
[coding-assistants policy](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-assistants.html)
allows disclosed AI assistance, is the one open upstream — which is what the
`submit/<base>/<category>` branches are for.

## How audio works on this device

The hardware, the layers, the two paths a sound can take, and the rules the
arrangement obeys — playback, the microphones, headset detection and call audio:

## Device tree

The board `.dtb` comes from five files; we touch **two**
(`sdm632-fairphone-fp3.dts`, `pmi632.dtsi`, +423/−4 lines, most of it the
integrated DT commit
[`ca289613`](https://github.com/llg179org/linux/commit/6749bae07da1)),
and 17 of the 20 upstream commits in the board file are in Linus' tree — the
SoC-level `msm8953.dtsi` much less so, which constrains what a
`submit/<base>/*` series may assume.

The trees themselves are checked in, with the full write-up — provenance,
genealogy, what each added node was derived from, and a node-by-node comparison
against Fairphone's published sources:
